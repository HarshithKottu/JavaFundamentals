Java 8 Features:
Functional Programming
Lambda Expression
Streams API
Optional Class
Functional Interfaces
DateTimeAPI

In an "Functional Interface" there should be only one SAM (single abstract method)
and as many as default or static methods

Why Functional Interfaces introduced?
-> To simplify anonymous inner classes especially in functional programming

Lambda Expression -> The implementation of functional interface (used to create instance)
