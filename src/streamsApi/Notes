Understand above 2 statements with 2nd statement as Example.

Data -> Intermediate operations
     -> Terminal Operations


From where does the employee Data comes from?
-> From the Database or from an csv file etc.,
-> we store this data from any of the above sources into a repository class (stores as a collection of large data)
-> This repository is used to make CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)


Streams:
    empList.stream()
            .intermediateOperation1()       ---> some filters by adding logics
            .intermediateOperation2()       ---> same
            .TerminalOperation()            ---> finally we have to modify the streams back to our required return format
